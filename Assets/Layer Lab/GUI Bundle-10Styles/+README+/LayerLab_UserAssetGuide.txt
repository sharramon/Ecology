## Bundle Asset User Guide

When you purchase a bundle pack, you are buying access to multiple connected assets at a discounted price.
Please note that the bundle pack itself does not contain files. Instead, it grants you free access to the individual assets included in the bundle.
For more details, please refer to the "GUI Bundle Asset" menu via the link above.

1. Free Access:
After purchasing a bundle pack, all assets connected to the bundle will be available for free.
   
2. Download Process:
You can download each asset individually at no cost through the Package Manager.

3. Alternative Access:
Alternatively, visit each asset's product page and click the "Open in Unity" button.

* Important Note:
Please note that it may take some time for the Asset Store system to update and reflect the free status of your assets. 
Rest assured, this is not an error with the asset pack itself.
If this happens, try downloading through the Package Manager or wait a moment before trying again.
